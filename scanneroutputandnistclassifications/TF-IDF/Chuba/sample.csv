36,A,A Nessus daemon is listening on the remote port.,AU-4,5000,565
222,B,According to the MAC address of its network adapter the remote host is a VMware virtual machine.,AU-25,370,565
329,B,Apache Tomcat is running on the remote host and is reporting its version number on the default error pages. A remote attacker can exploit this information to mount further attacks.,AU-40,5000,565
421,C,At least one of the X.509 certificates sent by the remote host has a key that is shorter than 2048 bits. According to industry standards set by the Certification Authority/Browser CA/B Forum certificates issued after January 1 2014 must be at least 2048 bits. Some browser SSL implementations may reject keys less than 2048 bits after January 1 2014. Additionally some SSL certificate vendors may revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1 2014.Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31 2010 as the standard considers them exempt.,AU-65,370,565
380,B,Based on the remote operating system it is possible to determine what the remote system type is eg: a printer router general-purpose computer etc.,AU-53,370,565
340,B,By calling the OPTIONS method it is possible to determine which HTTP methods are allowed on each directory. As this list may be incomplete the plugin also tests - if Thorough tests are enabled or Enable web applications tests is set to yes in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400403 405 or 501. Note that the plugin output is only informational and does not necessarily indicate the presence of any security vulnerabilities.,AU-45,370,565
285,B,By requesting a non-existent .aspx file on the remote web server itis possible to obtain the exact version number of the remote .NET framework.,AU-30,1200,565
43,A,By sending a Lookup request to the portmapper TCP 135 or epmapper PIPE it was possible to enumerate the Distributed Computing Environment DCE services running on the remote port. Using this information it is possible to connect and bind to each service by sending an RPC request to the remote port/pipe.,AU-11,2340,565
363,B,By using information obtained from a Nessus scan this plugin reports CPE Common Platform Enumeration matches for various hardware and software products found on a host. Note that if an official CPE is not available for the product this plugin computes the best possible CPE based on the information available from the scan.,AU-48,5000,565
56,A,COM+ Internet Services are RPC over HTTP tunneling and require IIS to operate.  CIS ports shouldn't be visible on internet but only behind a firewall.,AU-12,5000,565
143,A,Dell OpenManage Server Administrator OMSA a systems management server is running on the remote host.,AU-21,370,565
328,B,Each ethernet MAC address starts with a 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier OUI. These OUIs are registered by IEEE.,AU-39,2340,565
364,B,Hostnames different from the current hostname have been collected by miscellaneous plugins. Nessus has generated a list of hostnames that point to the remote host. Note that these are only the alternate hostnames for vhosts discovered on a web server. Different web servers may be hosted on name-based virtual hosts.,AU-49,370,565
38,A,It is possible to obtain information about the remote SSH server by sending an empty authentication request.,AU-6,1200,565
7,A,It is possible to obtain the banner of the remote FTP server by connecting to a remote port.,SC-1,370,370
268,B,It is possible to obtain the list of handlers the remote ASP.NET webserver supports.,AU-29,370,565
320,B,It was not possible to connect to PIPE\winreg on the remote host. If you intend to use Nessus to perform registry-based checks the registry checks will not work because the Remote Registry Access service winreg has been disabled on the remote host or can not be connected to with the supplied credentials.,AU-37,370,565
69,A,It was possible to identify the remote service by its banner or by looking at the error message it sends when it receives a HELPrequest.,AU-17,370,565
233,B,Local security checks have been disabled for this host because either the credentials supplied in the scan policy did not allow Nessus to log into it or some other problem occurred.,AU-27,2340,565
234,B,Nessus was able to identify the remote service by its banner or by looking at the error message it sends when it receives an HTTPrequest.,AU-28,5000,565
478,C,Nessus was able to login to the remote host using SSH or localcommands and extract the list of installed packages.,AU-81,370,565
57,A,Nessus was able to obtain the remote operating system name and version Windows and/or Samba by sending an authentication request to port139 or 445. Note that this plugin requires SMB1 to be enabled on the host.,AU-13,370,565
483,C,Nessus was able to obtain the version of SMB running on the remote host by sending an authentication request to port 139 or 445.Note that this plugin is a remote check and does not work on agents.,AU-83,2340,565
142,A,Nessus was able to resolve the fully qualified domain name FQDN of the remote host.,AU-20,5000,565
144,A,Nessus was able to run netstat on the remote host to enumerate the open ports. See the section plugins options about configuring this plugin.,AU-22,1200,565
404,C,Signing is not required on the remote SMB server. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.,AU-58,1200,565
66,A,Terminal Services allows a Windows user to remotely obtain a graphical login and therefore act as a local user on the remote host. If an attacker gains a valid login and password this service could be used to gain further access on the remote host.  An attacker may also use this service to mount a dictionary attack against the remote host to try to log in remotely. Note that RDP the Remote Desktop Protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks making it easy for attackers to steal the credentials of legitimate users by impersonating the Windows server.,AU-15,2340,565
360,B,The commonName CN attribute of the SSL certificate presented for this service is for a different machine.,AU-47,2340,565
448,C,signing is not required on the remote SMB server. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.,AU-76,5000,565
319,B,The Nessus scanner testing the remote host has been given SMB credentials to log into the remote host however these credentials do not have administrative privileges. Typically when Nessus performs a patch audit it logs into the remote host and reads the version of the DLLs on the remote host to determine if a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoft recommends to determine if a patch has been applied. If your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges when doing a scan then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch audit through the registry which may lead to false positives especially when using third-party patch auditing tools or to false negatives not all patches can be detected through the registry.,AU-36,5000,565
288,B,The remote ASP.NET web server is configured to show verbose error messages which might lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information about the remote installation such as the path under which the remote web server resides or about the remote ASP.NET applications.,AU-33,370,565
331,B,The remote FTP service supports the use of the AUTH TLS command to switch from a cleartext to an encrypted communications channel.,AU-42,1200,565
443,C,The remote host allows SSL/TLS connections with one or more Diffie-Hellman moduli less than or equal to 1024 bits. Through cryptanalysis a third party may be able to find the shared secret in a short amount of time depending on modulus size and attacker resources. This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext or potentially violate the integrity of connections.,AU-73,370,565
39,A,The remote host contains a file named robots.txt that is intended to prevent web robots from visiting certain directories in a website for maintenance or indexing purposes.  A malicious user may also be able tousle the contents of this file to learn of sensitive documents or directories on the affected site and either retrieve them directly or target them for other attacks.,AU-7,2340,565
441,C,The remote host has an SSL certificate chain with one or more SSL certificates that are going to expire soon. Failure to renew these certificates before the expiration date may result in denial of service for users.,AU-71,2340,565
406,C,The remote host has listening ports or established connections that Nessus was able to extract from the results of the netstat command.,AU-60,5000,565
37,A,The remote host is listening on UDP port 137 or TCP port 445 and replies to NetBIOS nbtscan or SMB requests. Note that this plugin gathers information to be used in other plugins but does not itself generate a report.,AU-5,370,565
419,C,The remote host is missing one or more security patches. This plugin lists the newest version of each patch to install to make sure the remote host is up-to-date.,AU-64,5000,565
42,A,The remote host is running a Microsoft Windows operating system or Samba a CIFS/SMB server for Unix. It was possible to log into it using one of the following accounts :- NULL session- Guest account- Supplied credentials,AU-10,1200,565
330,B,The remote host is running Citrix Licensing Service.,AU-41,370,565
35,A,The remote host is running MSSQL a database server from Microsoft. Itis possible to extract the version number of the remote installation from the server pre-login response.,AU-3,2340,565
442,C,The remote host supports EXPORT_DHE cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. Through cryptanalysis a third party can find the shared secret in a short amount of time. A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_DHE cipher suites. Thus it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites.,AU-72,5000,565
440,C,The remote host supports EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. An attacker can factor a 512-bit RSA modulus in a short amount of time. A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_RSA cipher suites e.g. CVE-2015-0204. Thus it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites.,AU-70,1200,565
449,C,The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack known as DROWN Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption. This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 SSLv2 implementation and it allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same private key.,AU-77,370,565
409,C,The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream decreasing its randomness. If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted e.g. HTTP cookies and an attacker is able to obtain many i.e. tens of millions ciphertexts the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.,AU-63,2340,565
332,B,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium strength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryption that uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits or else that uses the 3DES encryption suite. Note that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strength encryption if the attacker is on the same physical network.,AU-43,2340,565
390,C,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer Perfect Forward Secrecy PFS encryption.  These cipher suites ensure that recorded SSL traffic cannot be broken at a future date if the servers private key is compromised.,AU-56,5000,565
321,B,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer weak encryption. Note: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on the same physical network.,AU-38,1200,565
423,C,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that operate in Cipher Block Chaining CBC mode.  These cipher suites offer additional security over Electronic Codebook ECB mode but have the potential to leak information if used improperly.,AU-66,1200,565
444,C,The remote HTTPS server is not enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security HSTS. The lack of HSTS allows downgrade attacks SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks and weakens cookie-hijacking protections.,AU-74,1200,565
216,B,The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws including:  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes. An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients. Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better many web browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection such as in POODLE. Therefore it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely. NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSCs definition of strong cryptography.,AU-24,5000,565
485,C,The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has a number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0mitigate these problems but newer versions of TLS like 1.1 and 1.2 are designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible. PCI DSS v3.1 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 2018 except for point-of-sale terminals and their termination points.,AU-85,370,565
67,A,The remote service understands the CIFS Common Internet File System or Server Message Block SMB protocol used to provide shared access to files printers etc between nodes on a network.,AU-16,5000,565
457,C,The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that contains a self-signed root Certification Authority certificate at the top of the chain.,AU-78,1200,565
433,C,The remote SSH server is configured to allow either MD5 or 96-bit MAC algorithms both of which are considered weak. Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and it does not check for vulnerable software versions.,AU-69,370,565
377,B,The remote SSL/TLS server accepts a weak Diffie-Hellman DH public key value. This flaw may aid an attacker in conducting a man-in-the-middle MiTM attack against the remote server since it could enable a forced calculation of a fully predictable Diffie-Hellman secret. By itself this flaw is not sufficient to set up a MiTM attack hence a risk factor of None as it would require some SSL implementation flaws to affect one of the clients connecting to the remote host.,AU-52,5000,565
407,C,The remote Terminal Services is configured to use SSL/TLS.,AU-61,370,565
447,C,The remote web server hosts a version of Jenkins or Jenkins Enterprise that is prior to 1.638 or 1.625.2. It is therefore affected by a flaw in the Apache Commons Collections ACC library that allows the deserialization of unauthenticated Java objects. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the target host.,AU-75,2340,565
459,C,The remote web server hosts a version of Jenkins that is prior to2.44 or a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.32.2 or else a version of Jenkins Operations Center that is 1.625.x.y prior to 1.625.22.12.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.22.0.1 or 2.x.y.x prior to 2.32.2.1 or else aversion of Jenkins Enterprise that is 1.651.x.y prior to 1.651.22.12.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.22.0.1 or 2.x.y.z prior to 2.32.2.1. It is therefore affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - A DOM-based cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability    exists in jQuery Core due to improper validation of certain tags while being rendered using innerHTML. An    unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this via    a specially crafted request to execute arbitrary script    code in the users browser session. CVE-2011-4969  - An integer overflow condition exists in jBCrypt in the    key stretching implementation in gensalt within the    crypt_raw function which is triggered when the    log_rounds parameter is set to the maximum value 31.    An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to cause log_rounds to perform zero rounds allowing a brute-force attack to more easily determine the password    hash. CVE-2015-0886  - A cross-site request forgery vulnerability XSRF exists    due to several URLs related to group and role management    not requiring POST form submission. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to create unused roles    delete unused roles and set group descriptions. Note    that only Jenkins Enterprise is affected by this issue. CVE-2016-9887  - A flaw exists when sensitive data such as passwords is encrypted using AES-128 with electronic codebook mode    ECB. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this to disclose information about reused passwords.    CVE-2017-2598  - An unspecified flaw exists that is triggered when    handling new items due to insufficient permission    checks. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit    this by using the name of an already existing item to    create a new item that overwrites the existing item or to gain access to related objects. CVE-2017-2599  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to    improper permissions being set for accessing node    monitor data via the remote API. An authenticated    remote attacker can exploit this to disclose system    configuration and runtime information. CVE-2017-2600  - A stored cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability exists    due to improper validation of input to names and    descriptions fields before returning it to users. An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this via a    specially crafted request to execute arbitrary script    code in a users browser session. CVE-2017-2601  - A flaw exists in the Agent-to-Master Security Subsystem    because build metadata from the Pipeline suite is not    properly blacklisted. An authenticated remote attacker    can exploit this to overwrite metadata files.    CVE-2017-2602  - A flaw exists in the config.xml API when handling    user-initiated agent disconnects which results in User objects being included in the agent API output. An    authenticated remote attacker can exploit this to disclose sensitive information e.g. user API tokens.    CVE-2017-2603  - A flaw exists when handling permissions for    administrative monitors that allows an authenticated    remote attacker to access certain provided actions.    CVE-2017-2604  - A flaw exists in the Re-Key Admin Monitor when    re-encrypting secrets with a new key that results in old    secrets including the encryption key being stored    with world-readable permissions. A local attacker can    exploit this to disclose sensitive information from the    backup files. CVE-2017-2605  - A flaw exists in the internal API specifically within    the Jenkins::getItems function when requesting a list    of items via UnprotectedRootAction. An authenticated    remote attacker can exploit this to disclose information    regarding otherwise restricted items. CVE-2017-2606  - A stored cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability exists due to improper validation of input passed via    serialized console notes before returning it to users in    build logs. An authenticated remote attacker can    exploit this via a specially crafted request to    execute arbitrary script code in a users browser    session. CVE-2017-2607 - A flaw exists in the XStream-based API due to improper    validation of user-supplied input before it is    deserialized. An authenticated remote attacker can    exploit this via a specially crafted request to    execute arbitrary code. CVE-2017-2608  - A flaw exists in the search box implementation due to    the autocompletion feature displaying the names of    restricted views. An authenticated remote attacker can    exploit this to disclose sensitive names of views.    CVE-2017-2609  - A stored cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability exists    due to improper validation of input passed in user names    before returning it to users. An authenticated remote    attacker can exploit this via a specially crafted    request to execute arbitrary script code in a users    browser session. CVE-2017-2610  - A flaw exists due to improper validation of permissions to the /workspaceCleanup and /fingerprintCleanup URLs.    An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this to    cause a high load on the master and agents.    CVE-2017-2611  - A flaw exists due to a failure to properly restrict    access to JDK download credentials. An authenticated    remote attacker can exploit this to overwrite the    credentials thereby causing builds to fail.    CVE-2017-2612  - A cross-site request forgery XSRF vulnerability exists    due to a failure by HTTP GET requests to /user to    require multiple steps explicit confirmation or a    unique token when performing certain sensitive actions.    An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by    convincing a user to follow a specially crafted link to    cause the creation of new temporary users.    CVE-2017-2613,AU-80,5000,565
408,C,The remote web server hosts Jenkins a job scheduling / management system and a drop-in replacement for Hudson.,AU-62,1200,565
41,A,The remote web server is configured such that it does not return 404 Not Found error codes when a nonexistent file is requested perhaps returning instead a site map search page or authentication page. Nessus has enabled some counter measures for this.  However they might be insufficient.  If a great number of security holes are produced for this port they might not all be accurate.,AU-9,370,565
75,A,The remote web server uses its default welcome page. Therefore its probable that this server is not used at all or is serving content that is meant to be hidden.,AU-18,1200,565
458,C,The remote Windows host supports Server Message Block Protocol version 1 SMBv1. Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included in later SMB versions. Additionally the Shadow Brokers group reportedly has an exploit that affects SMB; however it is unknown if the exploit affects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this US-CERT recommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigate these potential issues.,AU-79,2340,565
365,B,The servers X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways in which the chain of trust can bebroken as stated below :  - First the top of the certificate chain sent by the    server might not be descended from a known public    certificate authority. This can occur either when the    top of the chain is an unrecognized self-signed    certificate or when intermediate certificates are    missing that would connect the top of the certificate    chain to a known public certificate authority.  - Second the certificate chain may contain a certificate    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the    certificates not Before dates or after one of the    certificates not After dates.  - Third the certificate chain may contain a signature    that either didn't match the certificates information    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be    verified are the result of the certificates issuer    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not    support or does not recognize. If the remote host is a public host in production any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.,AU-50,1200,565
357,B,The service running on the remote host presents an SSL certificate for which the commonName CN attribute does not match the hostname on which the service listens.,AU-46,1200,565
432,C,The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining CBC encryption.  This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext. Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and does not check for vulnerable software versions.,AU-68,5000,565
339,B,The SSL certificate associated with the remote service will expire soon.,AU-44,5000,565
492,C,The version of Jenkins installed on the remote host is affected by a cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability when using configuration tools such as JDK Maven or Ant are to build scripts. Tool names may not escape configuration forums properly resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.,AU-86,1200,565
479,C,The version of Jenkins running on the remote web server is prior to2.57 or is a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.46.2 or else it is a version of Jenkins Enterprise that is 1.625.x.y prior to 1.625.24.11.651.x.y prior to 1.651.24.1 2.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.24.0.1 or2.x.y.z prior to 2.46.2.1. It is therefore affected by multiple vulnerabilities :  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists within    core/src/main/java/jenkins/model/Jenkins.java that    allows an untrusted serialized Java SignedObject to be    transfered to the remoting-based Jenkins CLI and    deserialized using a new ObjectInputStream. By using a    specially crafted request an unauthenticated remote    attacker can exploit this issue to bypass existing    blacklist protection mechanisms and execute arbitrary    code. CVE-2017-1000353  - A flaw exists in the remoting-based CLI specifically in    the ClientAuthenticationCache.java class when storing    the encrypted username of a successfully authenticated    user in a cache file that is used to authenticate    further commands. An authenticated remote attacker who    has sufficient permissions to create secrets in Jenkins    and download their encrypted values can exploit this    issue to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same    instance. CVE-2017-1000354  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the XStream    library. An authenticated remote attacker who has    sufficient permissions such as creating or configuring    items views or jobs can exploit this to crash the Java    process by using specially crafted XML content.    CVE-2017-1000355  - Cross-site request forgery XSRF vulnerabilities exist    within multiple Java classes due to a failure to require    multiple steps explicit confirmation or a unique token    when performing certain sensitive actions. An    unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these to    perform several administrative actions by convincing a    user into opening a specially crafted web page.    CVE-2017-1000356Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the applications self-reported version number.,AU-82,1200,565
484,C,The version of Jenkins running on the remote web server is prior to2.89 or is a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.73.3.It is therefore affected by multiple vulnerabilities :  - Jenkins contains a flaw that allows traversing outside of a  restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly  sanitizing user input specifically slashes and path traversal  style attacks e.g. ../ supplied via usernames. With a  specially crafted username a remote attacker can overwrite  arbitrary files on the system.  - Jenkins contains a flaw that allows a stored cross-site  scripting XSS attack. This flaw exists because the program  does not validate autocomplete suggestions before returning it  to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially  crafted request that will execute arbitrary script code in a  users browser session within the trust relationship between  their browser and the server. Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the applications self-reported version number.,AU-84,5000,565
397,C,The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host. Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.,AU-57,370,565
34,A,This plugin attempts to determine the type and the version of the remote web server.,AU-2,1200,565
214,B,This plugin checks expiry dates of certificates associated with SSL-enabled services on the target and reports whether any have already expired.,AU-23,2340,565
58,A,This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.,AU-14,1200,565
382,B,This plugin detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.,AU-55,2340,565
