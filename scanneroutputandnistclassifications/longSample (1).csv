66,A,Terminal Services allows a Windows user to remotely obtain a graphicallogin and therefore act as a local user on the remote host.If an attacker gains a valid login and password this service could beused to gain further access on the remote host.  An attacker may alsouse this service to mount a dictionary attack against the remote hostto try to log in remotely.Note that RDP the Remote Desktop Protocol is vulnerable toMan-in-the-middle attacks making it easy for attackers to steal thecredentials of legitimate users by impersonating the Windows server.,AU-15,2340,565
360,B,The commonName CN attribute of the SSL certificate presented forthis service is for a different machine.,AU-47,2340,565
448,C,The Jenkins web server running on the remote host is affected by aremote code execution vulnerability due to unsafe deserialize calls ofunauthenticated Java objects to the Groovy library specifically theruntime.MethodClosure class. An unauthenticated remote attacker canexploit this via a crafted XML file to execute arbitrary code on thetarget host.Note that the Jenkins web server may be affected by othervulnerabilities as well; however Nessus has not tested for these.,AU-76,5000,565
319,B,The Nessus scanner testing the remote host has been given SMBcredentials to log into the remote host however these credentials donot have administrative privileges. Typically when Nessus performs a patch audit it logs into the remotehost and reads the version of the DLLs on the remote host to determineif a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoftrecommends to determine if a patch has been applied. If your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges whendoing a scan then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch auditthrough the registry which may lead to false positives especially whenusing third-party patch auditing tools or to false negatives not allpatches can be detected through the registry.,AU-36,5000,565
288,B,The remote ASP.NET web server is configured to show verboseerror messages which might lead to the disclosure of potentiallysensitive information about the remote installation such as thepath under which the remote web server resides or about theremote ASP.NET applications.,AU-33,370,565
331,B,The remote FTP service supports the use of the AUTH TLS command toswitch from a cleartext to an encrypted communications channel.,AU-42,1200,565
443,C,The remote host allows SSL/TLS connections with one or moreDiffie-Hellman moduli less than or equal to 1024 bits. Throughcryptanalysis a third party may be able to find the shared secret ina short amount of time depending on modulus size and attackerresources. This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext orpotentially violate the integrity of connections.,AU-73,370,565
39,A,The remote host contains a file named robots.txt that is intended toprevent web robots from visiting certain directories in a website formaintenance or indexing purposes.  A malicious user may also be able touse the contents of this file to learn of sensitive documents ordirectories on the affected site and either retrieve them directly ortarget them for other attacks.,AU-7,2340,565
441,C,The remote host has an SSL certificate chain with one or more SSLcertificates that are going to expire soon. Failure to renew thesecertificates before the expiration date may result in denial ofservice for users.,AU-71,2340,565
406,C,The remote host has listening ports or established connections thatNessus was able to extract from the results of the netstat command.,AU-60,5000,565

35,A,The remote host is running MSSQL a database server from Microsoft. Itis possible to extract the version number of the remote installationfrom the server pre-login response.,AU-3,2340,565
442,C,The remote host supports EXPORT_DHE cipher suites with keys less thanor equal to 512 bits. Through cryptanalysis a third party can findthe shared secret in a short amount of time.A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session touse EXPORT_DHE cipher suites. Thus it is recommended to removesupport for weak cipher suites.,AU-72,5000,565
440,C,The remote host supports EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less thanor equal to 512 bits. An attacker can factor a 512-bit RSA modulus ina short amount of time.A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session touse EXPORT_RSA cipher suites e.g. CVE-2015-0204. Thus it isrecommended to remove support for weak cipher suites.,AU-70,1200,565
449,C,The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by avulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher paddingoracle attack known as DROWN Decrypting RSA with Obsolete andWeakened eNcryption. This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in theSecure Sockets Layer Version 2 SSLv2 implementation and it allowscaptured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker canexploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previouslycaptured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series ofspecially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the sameprivate key.,AU-77,370,565
409,C,The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites.The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random streamof bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced intothe stream decreasing its randomness.If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted e.g. HTTP cookies and anattacker is able to obtain many i.e. tens of millions ciphertextsthe attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.,AU-63,2340,565
332,B,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer mediumstrength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryptionthat uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits or elsethat uses the 3DES encryption suite.Note that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strengthencryption if the attacker is on the same physical network.,AU-43,2340,565
390,C,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer PerfectForward Secrecy PFS encryption.  These cipher suites ensure thatrecorded SSL traffic cannot be broken at a future date if the serversprivate key is compromised.,AU-56,5000,565
321,B,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer weakencryption.Note: This is considerably easier to exploit if the attacker is on thesame physical network.,AU-38,1200,565
423,C,The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that operate in CipherBlock Chaining CBC mode.  These cipher suites offer additionalsecurity over Electronic Codebook ECB mode but have the potential toleak information if used improperly.,AU-66,1200,565
444,C,The remote HTTPS server is not enforcing HTTP Strict TransportSecurity HSTS. The lack of HSTS allows downgrade attacksSSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks and weakens cookie-hijackingprotections.,AU-74,1200,565
216,B,The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/orSSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographicflaws including:  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middleattacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service andclients.Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supportedversion of the protocol so that these versions will be used only ifthe client or server support nothing better many web browsersimplement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgradea connection such as in POODLE. Therefore it is recommended thatthese protocols be disabled entirely.NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for securecommunications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSCs definition of strongcryptography.,AU-24,5000,565
485,C,The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has anumber of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0mitigate these problems but newer versions of TLS like 1.1 and 1.2 aredesigned against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.PCI DSS v3.1 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 2018 exceptfor point-of-sale terminals and their termination points.,AU-85,370,565
67,A,The remote service understands the CIFS Common Internet File Systemor Server Message Block SMB protocol used to provide shared accessto files printers etc between nodes on a network.,AU-16,5000,565
457,C,The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that contains aself-signed root Certification Authority certificate at the top of thechain.,AU-78,1200,565
433,C,The remote SSH server is configured to allow either MD5 or 96-bit MACalgorithms both of which are considered weak.Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH serverand it does not check for vulnerable software versions.,AU-69,370,565
377,B,The remote SSL/TLS server accepts a weak Diffie-Hellman DH publickey value.This flaw may aid an attacker in conducting a man-in-the-middle MiTMattack against the remote server since it could enable a forcedcalculation of a fully predictable Diffie-Hellman secret.By itself this flaw is not sufficient to set up a MiTM attack hencea risk factor of None as it would require some SSL implementationflaws to affect one of the clients connecting to the remote host.,AU-52,5000,565
407,C,The remote Terminal Services is configured to use SSL/TLS.,AU-61,370,565
447,C,The remote web server hosts a version of Jenkins or Jenkins Enterprisethat is prior to 1.638 or 1.625.2. It is therefore affected by aflaw in the Apache Commons Collections ACC library that allows thedeserialization of unauthenticated Java objects. An unauthenticatedremote attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code on thetarget host.,AU-75,2340,565
459,C,The remote web server hosts a version of Jenkins that is prior to2.44 or a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.32.2 or else a versionof Jenkings Opertations Center that is 1.625.x.y prior to 1.625.22.12.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.22.0.1 or 2.x.y.x prior to 2.32.2.1 or else aversion of Jenkins Enterprise that is 1.651.x.y prior to 1.651.22.12.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.22.0.1 or 2.x.y.z prior to 2.32.2.1. It istherefore affected by the following vulnerabilities :  - A DOM-based cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability    exists in jQuery Core due to improper validation of    certain tags while being rendered using innerHTML. An    unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this via    a specially crafted request to execute arbitrary script    code in the users browser session. CVE-2011-4969  - An integer overflow condition exists in jBCrypt in the    key stretching implementation in gensalt within the    crypt_raw function which is triggered when the    log_rounds parameter is set to the maximum value 31.

408,C,The remote web server hosts Jenkins a job scheduling / managementsystem and a drop-in replacement for Hudson.,AU-62,1200,565
41,A,The remote web server is configured such that it does not return 404Not Found error codes when a nonexistent file is requested perhapsreturning instead a site map search page or authentication page.Nessus has enabled some counter measures for this.  However theymight be insufficient.  If a great number of security holes areproduced for this port they might not all be accurate.,AU-9,370,565
75,A,The remote web server uses its default welcome page. Therefore itsprobable that this server is not used at all or is serving contentthat is meant to be hidden.,AU-18,1200,565
458,C,The remote Windows host supports Server Message Block Protocolversion 1 SMBv1. Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the useof SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included inlater SMB versions. Additionally the Shadow Brokers group reportedlyhas an exploit that affects SMB; however it is unknown if the exploitaffects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this US-CERTrecommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigatethese potential issues.,AU-79,2340,565
365,B,The servers X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation canoccur in three different ways in which the chain of trust can bebroken as stated below :  - First the top of the certificate chain sent by the    server might not be descended from a known public    certificate authority. This can occur either when the    top of the chain is an unrecognized self-signed    certificate or when intermediate certificates are    missing that would connect the top of the certificate    chain to a known public certificate authority.  - Second the certificate chain may contain a certificate    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the    certificates notBefore dates or after one of the    certificates notAfter dates.  - Third the certificate chain may contain a signature    that either didnt match the certificates information    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be    verified are the result of the certificates issuer    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not    support or does not recognize.If the remote host is a public host in production any break in thechain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.,AU-50,1200,565
357,B,The service running on the remote host presents an SSL certificate forwhich the commonName CN attribute does not match the hostname onwhich the service listens.,AU-46,1200,565
432,C,The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining CBCencryption.  This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext messagefrom the ciphertext. Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server anddoes not check for vulnerable software versions.,AU-68,5000,565
339,B,The SSL certificate associated with the remote service will expiresoon.,AU-44,5000,565
492,C,The version of Jenkins installed on the remote host isaffected by a cross-site scripting XSS vulnerability when usingconfiguration tools such as JDK Maven or Ant are to build scripts.Tool names may not escape configuration forums properly resulting in astored cross-site scripting vulnerability.,AU-86,1200,565
479,C,The version of Jenkins running on the remote web server is prior to2.57 or is a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.46.2 or else it isa version of Jenkins Enterprise that is 1.625.x.y prior to 1.625.24.11.651.x.y prior to 1.651.24.1 2.7.x.0.y prior to 2.7.24.0.1 or2.x.y.z prior to 2.46.2.1. It is therefore affected by multiplevulnerabilities :  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists within    core/src/main/java/jenkins/model/Jenkins.java that    allows an untrusted serialized Java SignedObject to be    transfered to the remoting-based Jenkins CLI and    deserialized using a new ObjectInputStream. By using a    specially crafted request an unauthenticated remote    attacker can exploit this issue to bypass existing    blacklist protection mechanisms and execute arbitrary    code. CVE-2017-1000353  - A flaw exists in the remoting-based CLI specifically in    the ClientAuthenticationCache.java class when storing    the encrypted username of a successfully authenticated    user in a cache file that is used to authenticate    further commands. An authenticated remote attacker who    has sufficient permissions to create secrets in Jenkins    and download their encrypted values can exploit this    issue to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same    instance. CVE-2017-1000354  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the XStream    library. An authenticated remote attacker who has    sufficient permissions such as creating or configuring    items views or jobs can exploit this to crash the Java    process by using specially crafted XML content.    CVE-2017-1000355  - Cross-site request forgery XSRF vulnerabilities exist    within multiple Java classes due to a failure to require    multiple steps explicit confirmation or a unique token    when performing certain sensitive actions. An    unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these to    perform several administrative actions by convincing a    user into opening a specially crafted web page.    CVE-2017-1000356Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has insteadrelied only on the applications self-reported version number.,AU-82,1200,565
484,C,The version of Jenkins running on the remote web server is prior to2.89 or is a version of Jenkins LTS prior to 2.73.3.It is therefore affected by multiple vulnerabilities :  - Jenkins contains a flaw that allows traversing outside of a  restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly  sanitizing user input specifically slashes and path traversal  style attacks e.g. ../ supplied via usernames. With a  specially crafted username a remote attacker can overwrite  arbitrary files on the system.  - Jenkins contains a flaw that allows a stored cross-site  scripting XSS attack. This flaw exists because the program  does not validate autocomplete suggestions before returning it  to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially  crafted request that will execute arbitrary script code in a  users browser session within the trust relationship between  their browser and the server.Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has insteadrelied only on the applications self-reported version number.,AU-84,5000,565
397,C,The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by arecognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public hostin production this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establisha man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.
